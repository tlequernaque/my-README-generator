  ## Description
  This code was developed to generate a READme.md file. When you type node index.js on the terminal a series of questions will be asked. The program will ask questions regarding your GitHub username, email address, a project name, a description of the project, a type of license, any dependencies to install, command to run tests, any info about the repo, and any contributions. After all the questions are answered a new READme file will be created to include all answers along with a table of content.
